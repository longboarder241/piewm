Changes for version 1.04:

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=ports/94378
Succinctly, the #define for EXTRA in parse.c needs to be (at least) 12,

Changes for version 1.03:

Botched some prototypes.  1.02 wouldn't compile.

Changes for version 1.02:

I wasn't wait()ing for m4 to quit, so it hung around as a zombie.
When using RandomPlacement, the window is placed in such a position as to ensure
	that the cursor is inside the window.  This makes
	focus-follows-mouse (e.g. me) happier.

Changes for version 1.01:

Turned on -DSHAPE to get shaped window titles. (Cool!)
Removed shape detection code from ShapePieMenu();
Added prototypes (duh - this is 1998, everyone has gcc)
Fixed problems turned up by use of prototypes (double duh)
Made a few functions static.
Changed operation of pie menus.  If you release the button without making a
	selection, the mouse was and is grabbed.  Only, now, the menu
	tracks the pointer, to make it more obvious that the pointer
	is grabbed.  It also makes it a LOT easier to dismiss the
	menu.
Nobody used WarpToWindowEdge(), so it's gone.
Nobody used MkQte() either.
With shaped pie menus, we need to draw a border, so there's now code to
	do it in PaintPieMenuEntry.  Pity the code's not exactly right.
Added a -s switch to m4 invocation so we could get accurate error
	messages, as well as setting yylineno.
Removed the umd group cruft.  Astoundingly lame.
Changed operation of the panner.  Button 1 now moves the panner window using
	a grid the size of the window.  Button 3 still gives you the
	old operation which lets you put the panner window anywhere
	you want.  Old grid operation, when you held a modifier key
	while moving the panner window, removed.
Bison didn't like the default action on the LB .... RB statements, so I
	added a null action.
flex internals aren't compatible with at&t lex internals, so the at&t
	lex internal cruft got removed and replaced with documented
	flex cruft.

Changes from piewm distribution to version 1.00:

Removed Xpm from distribution since it's standard
Added shaped menus, but disabled use.
Removed a few private references to Display *.
Added another parameter to select() call.
Added documentation to system.twmrc
Added my own .twmrc to sample-twmrc
Updated Makefile by running xmkmf
